      <description>How do you know what predictors to include in a model? Here my notes on the topic from a conversation with Dr. Matt Espe, as well as from Dr. Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking textbook (1st Edition). When you include a predictor in a model, you are assuming that the samples at different levels of that predictor are not exchangeable: different levels within the predictor have different effects on the response.</description>

      <description>Project Prep  Packages you’ll need: tidyverse (or individual components therein: readr, dplyr, ggplot2). Suggested package(s): extrafont, hrbrthemes.
  What is an encounter history? When working with tagged fish swimming in a river, we often generate a record of each fish’s “encounters” with the autonomous monitors in an underwater array. If this in no way applies to your work, you can think of an encounter history as a simple set of Bernoulli trials, with successes (1s) or failures (0s).</description>

      <description>Well hello! Welcome to the Cramer Fish Sciences data science blog, the product of a handful of nerds at Cramer Fish Sciences. We’re here to share things about fish, fish science, coding, data visualization, and statistics.
Myfanwy will be the one who can’t stop talking about fishy viz (visualization of fish data). Travis likes to think and write about simulation models and R workflows for fish sciences. Kevin is actually a tree geek, but we let him talk about fish sometimes.</description>
