      <description>What is an encounter history? When working with acoustically-tagged fish, we often generate a record of each fish’s “encounters” with the autonomous acoustic monitors in an underwater array. If this in no way applies to your work, you can think of an encounter history as a simple set of Bernoulli trials, with successes (1s) or failures (0s). These encounter histories are simply the translation of a fish’s path into a row of ones and zeros, each corresponding to a positive or negative detection record at a receiver location in the acoustic array.</description>

      <description>Well hello! Welcome to the Cramer Fish Sciences data science blog, the product of a handful of nerds at Cramer Fish Sciences. We’re here to share things about fish, fish science, coding, data visualization, and statistics.
Myfanwy will be the one who can’t stop talking about fishy viz (visualization of fish data). Travis likes to think and write about simulation models and R workflows for fish sciences. Kevin is actually a tree geek, but we let him talk about fish sometimes.</description>
