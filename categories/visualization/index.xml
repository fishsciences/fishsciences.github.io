      <description>Background The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is an inland freshwater estuary subject to intensive management. The Delta Simulation Model II (DSM2) is one of the most commonly used hydrodynamic models for Delta planning and management with modules for hydrodynamics (HYDRO), water quality (QUAL), and particle tracking (PTM). The California Department of Water Resources uses DSM2 for planning and operation of the State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) diversion pumping as well as for management and satisfaction of stringent water quality standards.</description>

      <description>Project Prep  Packages you’ll need: tidyverse (or individual components therein: readr, dplyr, ggplot2). Suggested package(s): extrafont, hrbrthemes.
  What is an encounter history? When working with tagged fish swimming in a river, we often generate a record of each fish’s “encounters” with the autonomous monitors in an underwater array. If this in no way applies to your work, you can think of an encounter history as a simple set of Bernoulli trials, with successes (1s) or failures (0s).</description>
